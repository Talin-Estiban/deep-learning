Lung cancer classification and data balancing 
In this project, I compared between different data balancing techniques in order to maximize the performance of the model
in lung tumor classification. The techniques used are:
1. SMOTE ( Synthetic Minority Over-sampling technique).
2. Data augmentation.
3. Weights.
4. ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling).
5. K-Mean + SMOTE.
In order to run the model you need the dataset of lung CT from this link:

And also you need to gather some CT scans for predictions from:
